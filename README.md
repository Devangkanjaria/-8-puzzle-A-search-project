# 🧩 8-Puzzle Solver using A* Search in Python

An intelligent pathfinding solver for the classic 8-puzzle problem, built using Python’s `heapq`, `dataclasses`, and algorithmic logic. This project demonstrates A* Search implementation with Manhattan Distance as the heuristic, solving puzzles in the shortest path possible.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ A* Search Algorithm Implementation
- ✅ Manhattan Distance Heuristic Function
- ✅ Dynamic Node Expansion and State Transition
- ✅ Priority Queue with `heapq` for optimal node selection
- ✅ Visual Matrix-style Puzzle Output in CLI
- ✅ Object-Oriented Design with Class-based State Tracking

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Solve the 8-puzzle problem by finding the shortest sequence of moves that rearranges the tiles from the **start state** to the **goal state**, using:
- Efficient state exploration via A* algorithm
- Heuristic cost estimation using Manhattan Distance
